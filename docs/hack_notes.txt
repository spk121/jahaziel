Application Menu

	Concerns application as a whole, not an instance of an
	application.

LED Buttons

	Whether images appear on buttons can be modified by the theme,
	so I have to put images on the buttons explicitly, by having
	each button contains a box, and image, and a label.

Status Lights

	Since it is hard to know what is going on w.r.t the Videotex
	global switching mechanism, why not a set of status lights?
	(See chart in ETS 300 177).

	- ASCII
	- AM display
	- Old photo
	- Photographic (300 177)
	- Audio
	- Other

DFK - server Defined Function Keys

	When the server defines some DFKs, I'd like a DFK keyboard to
	appear.  But it might be much wider than the window.  Does
	that matter.

Login or connect

	Don't want to clutter the main window.

	- Press the launch button, which has a plug or power icon
	- Bring up a dialog to enter broker.
	- Dialog has text entry, history

	At that point, program requests directory at regular intervals
	and prints directory info in the main screen

Call somebody

	- Press the call button, which has a phone icon
	- Bring up a dialog to choose callee from directory

Bit Rates Minimums

	- 300 bps is just for fun: tee-hee!
	- 9600 bps ok for text: 1 AM page per second
	- 64000 bps is speech-only uncompressed 8-bit audio
        - N * 384 kpbs is for h.261, where N = 1 to 5
